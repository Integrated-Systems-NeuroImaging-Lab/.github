### Hi there 👋 

🦾 Welcome to the repository of the Integrated Systems & NeuroImaging Laboratory in the ECE Department at Rutgers University. Our lab is advised by Professor Laleh Najafizadeh.

🔬 Our research focuses on advancing science in multiple areas, including signal processing, applied machine learning, network science, bio-electronics, and biophotonics. We aim to develop multidisciplinary solutions for a variety of real-world problems. We are particularly interested in addressing challenges in neuroscience and healthcare, collaborating with biomedical engineers, neurobiologists, and psychologists.
